#### Developer
Currently obessed with React + flux and creating isomorphic web apps. I am the creator of world famous [instalfont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/installfont). I am also working in my spare time working on a web application that is going to completely change the future of the motion graphic template industry.

#### Motion Designer
In a previous life, I was obsessed with motion design and VFX which I did on a freelance basis as well become an [author on videohive](http://videohive.net/user/matsilva/portfolio).
