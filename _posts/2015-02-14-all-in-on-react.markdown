*I believe that React.js and flux architecture is where the industry is headed for years to come.* I believe it so much that I scooped up an in-person ticket to [React Week][rw]. This is a big deal for me because it completely ruins my chance of getting a drone for my birthday in June, which I have wanted for years now.

##Education value
I feel like you can't put at cap on continual education. If you love the field you are in you will most likely be a student of if your entire life. When I told my team leads at Twin Tech that I was considering going, their immediate response was very understanding towards the value of education. I feel like most companies, if they understand this value, will support and encourage their employee's on going education.

##Job security
Right now and previously on job boards, there is a bountiful search for MEAN stack developers. The MEAN stack has definitely been the cornerstone for the full stack Javascript industry, but I am predicting a transition is going to happen where job boards and recruiters will be predominately searching for React and flux developers in their full stack javascript queries. Getting hands on and fully absored with the technology and architecture gives me a great sense of job security for years to come. When new frameworks pop up, via the inevitable [Javascript framework churn](http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2014/12/the-state-of-javascript-in-2015/), I imagine they will be in compliance with the architecture being taught from React and flux.

##Is it better?
While job security is certainly nice, is React + flux actually better than current frameworks and typical application architecture? Short answer, yes(I may be biased...). Not just for Javascript but for other languages as well. The framework and architecture encourages self contained and re-usable components to build your application. Each component being concerned about it's own state. At first this seems slower and counter intuitive(which is natural since we are conditioned by previous framework's way of thinking), but you end up realizing how powerful it can be when buildig a scalable application.

##Scalable apps
What I mean by scalable is from a development perspective. Most companies will bring on new developers and they will be expected to be able to jump into an application and start developing. I can speak from experience, that when you are dealing with frameworks and an architecture that is not seperated into components, it is a total nightmare navigating and understanding the application. Throw in the background magic (aka convention over configuration) and you will certainly be swearing up a storm no matter who you are. Working with a component driven framework and forward moving architecture has made development in the long run significantly more productive. I admit my opinion of this is limited to what I currently know of React, but I plan to have a much better understanding of it after the [React Week workshop][rw], which by the way is [totally worth it](/workshops/2015/02/26/why-go-to-react-week/).
