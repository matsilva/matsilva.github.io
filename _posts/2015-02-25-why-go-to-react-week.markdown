When I was trying to rally some fellow developers to go with me to React Week in person, the average response went like this: “so what do they teach you there that you couldn’t learn online?”

##Justification
This is a really valid question and point, especially when trying to justify a $1000 ticket that doesn’t include the travel costs for a week. There are numerous online resources and training around react + flux. [egghead.io][egghead], [scotch.io][scotch] and even [facebook's react docs][react] to name a few. What could possibly make it so beneficial that I would bite the bullet on the expenses?

##The experience...

My response is pretty straight forward. I understand that everything they teach you could learn online. This I know from experience, since I have been hired in an area that I was self taught in. I am no stranger to picking up a new technology on the fly via online resources to become more valuable to the company and the project at hand. 

Even though you could learn all of the things being taught online, there is a massive difference when you work firsthand with top notch developers in that area. Your learning is significantly accelerated, the material absorbs into your cognitive skills with less friction and you also pick up their “PRO” habits. I feel like the “PRO” habits alone are invaluable for obvious reasons.

##Habits rub off
When you work closely with people who are smarter than you, it rubs off. If you become the smartest person on your team, it can become a problem because then your learning pace begins to slow down and can even come to a hault. This can be avoided if everyone on the team is continually growing and getting into situations where they can learn and work with people who are smarter than they are. This is where workshops can come in and really help refresh the development ecosystem in your work environment, which can bring out new ideas and innovations. It also helps that I am [all in on React](/workshops/2015/02/14/all-in-on-react/).
