I remember when I first started out as a motion designer, it was hard. There was no clear cut path, I basically had bookmarked tutorials from across the web to learn from and kept searching the web on a daily basis. Every freelance job I got was an opportunity to try something new or apply something I learned.

Each project, I usually slipped something in that was outside the scope of the work because I wanted to grow in my skills and have something to show for my portfolio. I always felt motivated by getting paid. It was validating both financially and psychologically. It made me feel like my hard work and creativity was appreciated and that I could continue to pursue new work.

Where I live(d), freelancing is difficult. My target audience is small businesses and individuals who can only afford to pay peanuts for a video. I heard a lot of, “it will be a good opportunity to put on your portfolio,” when the topic of payment came up. I also had to compete with local production companies who used After Effects<small><sup>&trade;</sup></small> templates and churned them out like a manufacture production line because their business model suggested volume over quality. I didn't really stand a chance, but it didn't keep me from busting my arse and trying.

Before I changed my career choice, I got into the online template business and created a handful of templates. I instantly loved doing it. Being able to create what I wanted and turn it into cash sounded amazing to me. I got customization inquiry emails all the time for my After Effects<small><sup>&trade;</sup></small> templates from customers who had purchased it and don't know how to use After Effects<small><sup>&trade;</sup></small>. I would charge $100 and wanted the quick cash, but the problem was by the time it was all said and done two days to one week later, it wasn't so quick! So I ended up saying no to most of these opportunities to make a little extra and turned away from pursuing online templates because I felt the target market was too small.

I ended up getting a job shortly after because I desperately needed one, so I put the kibosh on my motion design career and started focusing on my web development and programming career. What is awesome is those templates still generate small passive income every month for me to this day.

Many motion graphic artists may be at a similar point, looking to generate passive income or are looking for a way to learn and grow while validating their creativity. I believe RenderEffects will create that opportunity.



#### Performing a search on *how to make money with Blender*, I found these solutions.

* Sell 3D models
* Sell stock photos
* Freelance
* Sell game development assets
* Become a trainer

I don't think there is anything wrong with any of these verticals. I think they should definitely be taken advantage of by every artist. The part I want to focus on is the obvious limitations some of those verticals have.

For example, when you sell 3D models online, your target audience is immediately limited to other 3D artists who know how to use that 3D model file in either Blender or another proprietary software. Most humans don't possess those skills. Basically getting a 3D model is never my first choice when I freelance. The same thing goes for selling game development assets, though I hear it can be lucrative, you are still limited to this particular target audience.

RenderEffects was born to bridge the gap I see between motion graphic templates and entry-level consumers.

> *I want to provide a platform where artists can create a sustainable online business, learn, grow and make money from anywhere in the world*

My hope is that RenderEffects motivates motion graphic artists to start creating the animations they want to create and learn the things they want to learn, knowing they can translate their creativity into money. I want to provide a platform where artists can create a sustainable online business, learn, grow and make money from anywhere in the world. I firmly believe RenderEffects is that platform.
